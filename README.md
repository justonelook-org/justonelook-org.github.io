## The Just One Look Method
The Just One Look Method is an extremely simple approach to mental suffering unlike anything you have ever tried. It will rid you of the root cause of your dissatisfaction with life and the painful yearning for peace and fulfillment that seems never to be fully satisfied.

The Just One Look Method is the result of over twenty years of experience working with people all over the world who have seen their relationship with their own lives change dramatically for the better.

## Contributing and Volunteering to Maintain The Site
This guide explains how to add content to our site. We use a system called Just the Docs. You don't need to know code, but you do need to follow these specific rules.

### Cheat Sheet
Each page *must* contain these lines in the beginning of the document:

**Standard pages:**
```
---
layout: default
title: Your Page Title
parent: The Parent Section Name
nav_order: 1
---
```

**For parent pages (pages that will contain sub-pages):**
```
---
layout: default
title: Education
has_children: true
nav_order: 2
---
```

**Text Sizing**
Change the size of headings or paragraphs without changing the structure.
```
Make it Huge: {: .fs-9 } (Good for page titles)
Make it Tiny: {: .fs-2 } (Good for disclaimers)
Make it Light: {: .fw-300 } (Thinner font weight)
```
